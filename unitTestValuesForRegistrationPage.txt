Test Ideas for Reg page:

Test 1:
Tests that a correct registration works

fname = "john"
lname = "doe"
username = "JD2"
bio = "Hi I'm John Doe!"
email = johndoe2billion@gmail.com
password = johndoe
password2 = johndoe
male: selected
female: unselected
gaming: checked
organized: unchecked
party: unchecked
Cooking: unchecked
gym: checked
anime: checked
horror: unchecked
comedy: checked
mn: checked

(this should produce no errors and be pushed to the database. Not sure how to make that clear with a test. Perhaps check 
if the program says "You are now registered and can log in"?)
